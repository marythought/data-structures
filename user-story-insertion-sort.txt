Story:

As a data manager
I want my own insertion sort
so that I know how it works and when to use it.

Research:

Read about the Insertion Sort algorithm. Visualize (Links to an external site.) it. See how it works on different kinds of data sets (Links to an external site.).

Code:

Create your own data-structures repository (standard ruby project setup: lib/ and spec/ directories, etc) to hold your implementations of various data structures.

Use TDD/BDD to add your own insertion sort method on arrays.

Go through RED/GREEN/REFACTOR process. Once the tests are written and failing, get them passing with the necessary code. Then look for chances to clean up and improve your code.

Benchmark:

Now, benchmark random, best,  and worst-case examples: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/benchmark/rdoc/Benchmark.html#method-c-bm (Links to an external site.)

Submit:

Do all your work on a branch. Be sure to include in your README.md an explanation of your approach, and include all collaborators & sources. When complete, send a Pull Request to master.

Submit the link directly to your Pull Request. Merge it when you are ready.

Required: add Comments here with 1) time this assignment took and 2) your observations and reflections.
